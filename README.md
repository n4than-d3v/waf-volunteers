# Wildlife Aid Foundation

This repository contains code for the volunteer system used by the Wildlife Aid Foundation.

It consists of two projects, an Angular progressive web app for the front-end, and an ASP.NET Core Web API for the back-end.

The back-end uses a PostgreSQL database, and requires SMTP credentials to send email notifications.
